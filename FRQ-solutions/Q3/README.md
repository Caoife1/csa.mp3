#2024 FRQ Q3

## This question is about...
- Checking if the current word is within the next word.
- Also asks you to return a Arraylist of String but cuts off the `target`.

## Struggles with this question...
- How to add the correct Strings into the newly generated ArrayList.

## Prior expereiences that helped...
- Uses indexOf and substring.

## What I learned by doing this question..."
- A advanced for loop is needed because the whole Arraylist would need to be accessed.
